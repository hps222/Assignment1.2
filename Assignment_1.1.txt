1. Say True or False for the below statements: 

• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? 		
Answer: False

• Base R packages installed automatically? 	
Answer: True

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector? 
Answer: Recycling occurs when vector arithmetic is performed on multiple vectors of different sizes. R takes shorter vector and repeats them until it becomes long enough to match the longer one.


3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
> x=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) + c(1, 3)
> x

Answer:
[1] 2 5 4 7 6 9

Internally c(1, 3) vector repeat itself to form c(1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3) to match the previous term.
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) + c(1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3)
1+1, 2+3, 3+1, 4+3, 5+1, 6+3 
2  5  4  7  6  9
